Java Script

	HTMl - Markup 
	CSS - Create good look and feel
	JS/JQuery - Logic inside page


	Java Script is used to define function in webpage
	Task of function
		Take input, perform action and provide output

				public int getHello(int a,int b){
						return a+b;
				}
	Object oriented programming language
		oops - class, object, inheritance, polymorphism, abstarction, encapsulation
	Developed by Netscape Corporation in 1996
		Java    />javac    Hello.java
			/>java     Hello            JVM (compile java)


		JS      />Browser
						    JS Engine (compile JS)
	JS is used in browser
	Js is one type of scripting language ---> light weight programming
	Scripting language & Programming language:
		SL - Less powerful as most of the complex logic we can not implement
		   - Lines end with ; but use is optional
		   - Interpreter based ---> hello.js => NC/MC
		   - Example ---> PYTHON JAVA SCRIPT etc...

			print();

		PL - More powerful as most of the complex logic we can implement
		   - Lines end with ; and use in mandatory
		   - Compiler based ---> Hello.java => Hello class NC
		   - Example ---> JAVA C# etc... 

	<head> - is the logical part of our code 
	<body> -

	--- version 
		ES5
		ES6

	The JavaScript naming convention started with ES1, ES2 ES3 ES4 ES5 & ES6
	But, ECMAScript 2016 and 2017 was not called ES7 & ES8
	Since, 2016 new versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016/2017/2018)


Why JavaScript implementations are available?
	The first JS was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape

	Window is a class that represents browser
	Document is object that represent page
	Inside window we can have multiple object ex: document

	We can write html inside JS
	html files are like exe files.we have to use <script> to include js 

	JS can be written in common area or in a block
	Block is more powerful than common area


In Scripting variable is implicit:
	During runtime interpreter try to understand what you have declared
	what data type it is based on data
In programming language variable is explicit:
	Programmer must declare the data type in the code like : int float etc....


Variable creation features:
	Variable should start with alphabet
	Variable should not contain special character
	Variable are case sensitive 
	Variable start with var

	int a=10; // java ---> explicit
	var b="hello" // js ---> implicit



Data Types:
	Primitive (int,float,string,boolean,undefined,null)
	Non-Primitive datatypes(object)

	<SCRIPT type ="text/javascript" language="javascript">
	var x=60;
	document.write("the value is "+x+"<br>");
	var y=hello;
	document.write("the value is "+y+"<br>");
	</script>

	String declaration using "' is same as python
		document.write('This is "good" book');
		document.write("This is 'good' book");
		document.write("This is "good" book");  ---> error syntax   //ctrl+shift+j to check error 
		document.write('This is 'good' book');  ---> error syntax
	

<noscript> 
	Sometimes we are confused weather browser does not support JS or we have some error in the JS code
	IE doesnot suppprt JS by default

Loops:


Functions:
	Code reusability
	A function is a group od reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program
	This eliminates the need of writting the same code again and again
	It helps programmers in writtiong modular codes
	Functions allow a programmer to divide a big problem into a number of small and manageable functions


Event:


Big Arrow (Fat Arrow) Functions:
	Before this new standard, JS used the function keyword to create functions
	Now we can use this big arrow => to write functions

	/pre ES-6
		function add(num1 , num2){
			return(num1+num2);
		}

	/Lamda or Big Arrow
		num 1, num 2=>num1 + num2;
	


Selector ---> Id Class Element
	$()
	element inside a parenthesis is element selector
	id inside a parenthesis is id selector
	class inside a parenthesis is class selector

$("h1") - selector - element
<h1> Welcome to JQuery </h1>

$("pp") - selector - id
<h1> Welcome to JQuery </h1>

$("dd") - selector - class
<h1> Welcome to JQuery </h1>

======JAVA SCRIPT ADVANCED======

JS Global Function:
	Pre defined function


The error object :
	JS has a built in error object that provides error information when an error occurs.
	The error object provides two useful properties : name and message

Finally - two different cases
	  Some of the statement we can write inside a try block but it is possible that the JS Engine may avoid the execution of those lines of code
	  CASE 1 :
		We have written statement where the previous line throw error then this line can never be executed
	  CASE 2 :
		It is possible that JS Engine may avoid the execution of Non - JS object
			File object
			Db object etc...

Six different types of errors:
EvalError
RangeError
ReferenceError
SyntaxError 
TypeError
URI Error
