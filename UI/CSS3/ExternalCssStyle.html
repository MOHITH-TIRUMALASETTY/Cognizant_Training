        Cloud data refers to data stored, managed, and accessed on remote servers (the cloud)
        rather than on local devices or on-premises systems. It's a model of data storage where information
        is stored remotely and accessed over the internet. Cloud data platforms, in turn,
        are integrated solutions that provide a unified environment for managing, analyzing, and
        leveraging data from various sources in the cloud
